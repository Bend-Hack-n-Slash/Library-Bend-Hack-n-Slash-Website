# Biolab

This page details what is needed to construct, focused on open source solutions and cheaper DIY equipment, and safely operate a Biology lab.

This is filed under the Chemistry Lab because much of what is needed in a biolab is also needed in a chemistry lab. The main difference is Biolabs require a few extra pieces of equipment as well as very cold and stable storage.

## Sources

Below are sources I've pulled from to create this page:
* [Excedr.com biology lab equipment list](https://www.excedr.com/blog/biology-lab-equipment-list/):	Good list of what equipment is needed in a lab. Biology specific equipment has a short description and list of popular brands. General lab equipment is just listed.
* [Makezine's how to set up your own biolab](https://makezine.com/2017/04/11/how-to-set-up-your-own-lab/): Article that looks at putting together a cheap home hobby lab for around $500. Goes into how to use and modify more commonly available stuff to work well enough.
* [wbdg Notes on research lab building design](https://www.wbdg.org/building-types/research-facilities/research-laboratory): Not directly related to this spreadsheet, but looks into the consideration needed when building a laboratory research building. Has info on lab layout so may be tangentially useful.
* [Fablabwgtn DIY Biolab](https://fablabwgtn.github.io/DIY-biolab/lab/DIY-biolab.html): Covers a small groups experience in building and using their own biolab.

## Construction

### Building

Some considerations for the building/room the lab will be:

* Electricity as we need to run the equipment, but it needs to have fault tolerance since temperature fluctuations are very bad for stored specimens. At the very least, the fridges should have some form of backup power if there is power loss.

* Ventilation. Same as a chemistry lab, good ventilation is needed to remove fumes from chemicals.
    * Fume Hood Area for even better ventilation in a small work area.
    
* Water.

### Equipment

| Name            | Description |
|-----------------|----|
| Centrifuge      | Spins a material to separate a solution based on density. |
| Lab Scale       |  |
| Magnetic Stirrers | |

**Biolab Specific Equipment**

| Name            | Description |
|-----------------|----|
| Autoclave       | Allows controlling temperature and pressure within the device. Often used for sterilization. |
| CO2 Incubator   | Sealed, climate-controlled space used to grow cell cultures in an environment where the oxygen & CO2 levels can be controlled. |
| Roller Drum     | |
| -80C Fridge (Ultra-Low Temperature) | Storage of biological samples while waiting to be used |
| -20C Fridge     | Storage of samples that are actively being used. |
| Micro Pipette   | Fine control of releasing liquids into sample dish's. |
| Polymerase Chain Reaction (PRC) System | Used to amplify DNA sequences. |

**Glassware**

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
| Reagent Bottles | |
| Media Bottles | |
| Test Tubes | |
| Micro Centrifuge Tubes | |
| Petri Dishes | |
| Pipette Tips | |
| Graduated Conical Flask | |

Note you will also need reagents which will be covered in the operations section of this page.
