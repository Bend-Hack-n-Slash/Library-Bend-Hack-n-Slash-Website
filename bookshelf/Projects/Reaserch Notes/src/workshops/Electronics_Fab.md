## Integrated Chip Fab
[DIY chips at home](http://sam.zeloof.xyz/second-ic/)

Sam Zeloof built a home fab that was able to make a 6 transistor amp chip. More recently he managed to make 1000+ transistors on a single chip though has not made it into a functional chip, he is just working on improving processes to get transistor count and success rate up.

His work will make a good base for devleloping tools to make this kind of thing easier.
