The idea is to make your own super caps using:

* A cheap, off the shelf, 4-5 nm, laser that's arounf 5 watts
* Kapton tap or [Polyimide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyimide)
* A XY cam system that you can attach the laser to.
* An electrolyte. He used sulfuric acid with a wicking material to hold it. Mentions scientists would normally use a gel type of electrolyte.
* Something to enclose it in. He sandwiched it between microscope slids.

Apparently when a laser hits Polyimide it produces a type of graphene that is "foamy" giving it a large surface area, though lower conductance. When used to make interlocking fingers of a capacitor, it can hold a decent charge.
