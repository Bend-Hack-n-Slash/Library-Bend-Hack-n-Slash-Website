The video was mostly about super capacitors (and that info is documented in the super capacitor page) but the end of the video talked about how you could also make a high temperature, extremely even heater. Due to being made from Kapton tape the heater would degrade as the temperatures got in the 400 C range, presumably due to the adhesive breaking apart.
