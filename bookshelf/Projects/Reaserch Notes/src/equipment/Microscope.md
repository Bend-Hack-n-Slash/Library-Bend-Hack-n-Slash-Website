Open source project for building high precision mechanical positioning specifically for use in microscopes and micromanipulators. By using 3D printer, the flexible plastic platform can be made cheaply. Overall the project allows produceing a cheap, high precition microscope. It can be used with normal lenses, or configured as a digital microscope with a bit more parts.
