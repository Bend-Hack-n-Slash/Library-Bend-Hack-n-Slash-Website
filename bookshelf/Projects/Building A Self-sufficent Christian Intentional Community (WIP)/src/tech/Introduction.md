# Technical Design

The Technical Design will deal with technology that can allow a community to be self-sufficient. However, these technologies vary depending on your situation, and are able to change as new scientific discoveries are made. As such, it is not really possible to exhaustively list out, or even explore all the best technologies for self-sufficiency, because each situation can have unique elements that the authors cannot think of, and even if we could make such a list it would quickly go out of date. 

Instead a methodology that can be followed to re-purpose and develop technology is far more valuable. As such, the first half of the technical design will go over the methodology needed in designing technology for a self-sufficient community. The second half will look at a specific technology stack, stack meaning technologies from the lowest level to the highest each building on the previous.

You will then be able to use the methodologies learned in the first half to swap out obsolete or less efficient technologies that we lay out in the second half.
