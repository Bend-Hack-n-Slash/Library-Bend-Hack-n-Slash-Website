# Physical Design

The physical design should be based around closed cycles. Each step in the cycle should have multiple sources and multiple outputs. There needs to be multiple inputs so if something fails, say a drought kills off this year's crop, the community is not devastated. There should be multiple outputs so that each bit of work done is more efficient providing several things to the community. An example of this is that when butchering an animal you should use every piece of it.

This document will go over several “cycles”, or ecosystems, to help break down the design into more manageable bits. However, every cycle will have a lot of interdependence. Like how the power cycle and food cycle can be very connected, where power is used to make food and food animal and plant products can be used to make power. Also each community may need completely different designs depending on their location.
