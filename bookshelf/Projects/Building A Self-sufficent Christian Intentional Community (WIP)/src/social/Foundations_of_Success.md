## Foundations to Success

This section will layout some foundational ideas that should lead to success.

### Foundations to Avoiding Failure

1. **Enforcement**: The community needs a system for motivation that can be levied against members to enforce productivity. Simply assuming that "everyone will pitch in as they can” will quickly lead to ideas of “Well, I don't feel like it right now, so I'll just slack off a little..." which creates a feedback loop that leads to the community collapsing from inability to support itself.
    
    What the motivation **is** varies, and must be well defined for a successful group. It could be something like a punishment for slacking off or rewarded for working. Likely the best way would be the later and do it via a currency. 

2. **Specific Goal**: The community needs an active, specific goal to work towards that both A) allows members to measure the group’s success, and B) unifies the community. It is important that this goal is concrete and well defined. Otherwise there will be waste and conflict as people try to move in different directions.

3. **Concrete Dividing Line**: The community needs to have a well defined line dividing outside from inside, community from not-community. Similar to the goal, this line is a unifying factor. Not so much a Us vs Them, though if not careful could easily devolve to this, but rather a line defining why we need the separation at all.

### Foundations of the Social Contract

1. **Clear**: The social contract needs to be clear and understandable. There should be no double speak or attempts to hide functionality. This should help remove creative interpretations of what was really meant.

2. **Complete**: The social contract needs to address everything about each topic it addresses. The edge cases need to be pointed out.
