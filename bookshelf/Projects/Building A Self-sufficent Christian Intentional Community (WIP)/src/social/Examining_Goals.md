# Examining the Goals

## Restating the Goals

The goals for the resulting community as stated before are:

1. Promoting the values set forth in the Bible.
1. Promoting individual freedom and privacy within those values.
1. Promoting corporate well-being within those freedoms.
1. Promoting personal improvement.
1. Promoting the pursuit and distribution of knowledge.

## A Basic Understanding of People

Before going forward we need to establish a definition of the most likely failure point of any system. The people themselves. As Christians we should be able to agree that people are far from perfect and will be corrupt if given the chance.
