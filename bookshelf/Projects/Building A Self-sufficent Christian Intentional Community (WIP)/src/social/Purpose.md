# Social Design

## Purpose for the Social Design

The social design has several purposes. 

First, the social design exists to **Prevent External Strife**, issues with those outside the community. The community's purpose is not to replace the nation, but to build an identity within, one of many that make up the whole nation. We do this by leveraging the nation's legal system to build a legal identity within the nation. This identity allows the community to legally govern itself, provide a buffer between it's people and those outside the community, and prevents causing issues with the host nation as some sort of identity that is compeating with the nation instead of being a subset of it. 

Second, the social design exists to **Prevent Internal Strife**, issues between people within the community. Prevention is preferable to punishment, and the design needs to have a heavy emphasis on catching and dealing with problems before they happen.

Third, the social design exists to **Dictate Acceptable Punishments** so we know how to handle issues that have already occured. Inevitably something will happen that must be addressed, and we need to have paths already in place. Our resolutions must work within the legal system of the nation, but when they have no clear stance on something we need to promote a healthy balance of justice and mercy.

Finally, the social design exists to **Dictate Day to Day Operations**, so we have clear guidelines on how to keep the whole system running. We need to know who has what position and what tasks they are and are not responsible to handle. We need people to be balanced against each other and informed of each others decisions to prevent corruption. And we need clear processes for handling emergencies.

## The Result

The social design should result in a charter that is a legal document within the host nation and should explicitly detail: 

* Admittance Requirements
* Handling Departures
* Community Rules and Punishments for Infringements
* Governance

**(TODO likely more areas are needed, this list is an off the top of my head deal)** 

This design should first be put to plain language, then will need to be put into legal language via a lawyer with a contract that all community participants current and future will sign.
