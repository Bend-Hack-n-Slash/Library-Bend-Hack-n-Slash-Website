# Defining Some Terms

Lets first define what we mean by a **Self-sufficient Christian Intentional Community**

## Intentional Community

Community is obviously the core concept of this idea and needs defining. In these documents, “community” will usually refer to a local, small community of like-minded individuals that have closely meshed values. This is in contrast to other communities like the global community and the national community which both cover many people of differing values. The idea here is to set up a partition between the local community and other outside communities.

Community is an important aspect because going out into the woods on your own is bad for multiple reasons. 
* **First**, humans are social creatures that need other humans to have healthy meaningful lives. There is a reason solitary confinement is a punishment. Extended loneliness can damage the mental health of an individual at best making them miserable and at worse driving them insane. 
* **Second**, an isolated lifestyle would be very fragile both in security from threats and ability to produce what you need. If you get hurt there is no one around to pick up the slack while you recover. If you have to fight, numbers can be the difference between win or die. The ability to put multiple minds onto a problem allows for better solutions. And the old saying “many hands make light work” is true. 
* **Finally**, but most importantly, as Christians we are commanded to serve others in our daily lives; trying to fully isolate oneself would go against this.

The idea of building a community somewhat separate from the greater national or global community is not new, rather it is a very old concept. Monasteries existed with the purpose to sequester it's members away from the outside world often dedicated to providing for themselves through their own labor. There have also been various social experiments, often called Communes, that have tried a similar separation many times throughout history with varying results. However since both Communes and Monasteries are terms heavily laden with meaning, one of the modern names for this kind of community is “Intentional Community”, a community built intentionally picking neighbors with similar beliefs and worldview rather than neighbors being whoever happens to move in next door. Intentional Community is a more generic term avoiding a specific governing philosophy or religious attachment.

This book goes into detail on designing such an intentional community both from a social and technical point of view.



## Self-sufficient

While not strictly necessary for this kind of endeavor, a community that can provide for itself is much more secure and independent then one that cannot. If something goes wrong within the community, the members can go into the national community to fix the issue. However, if something goes wrong outside the community and the community is not self-sufficient, not only can members not help those in need, but the community itself is in danger.

Self-sufficiency is further covered in most of the technical section which tries to lay out ways to make the community self-sufficient.



## Christian

As Christians we should avoid a complete decoupling from society as we need to bear a witness of Christ to the unsaved. The internet and modern transport technologies provide a median option: Construct a Christian community, but, via trips to other communities and work through the internet, continue to share Christ to the greater world.

The benefit of organizing into such a community is to facilitate individual and corporate Christian growth in a safe environment with a tight knit group while still connecting with the local community for outreach ministries and entrepreneurial ventures. 

This book’s purpose is not to exhaustively define what a “Christian” is, but does look at the design of a community from a Christian perspective. So a very basic definition will be placed here:
1. The Bible is God’s word to us and reveals God and His plan for the world to us.
1. Because of the fall, Humanity’s natural state is sinful.
1. Christ is divine and our only path of salvation is His freely given gift.
1. Man’s primary purpose is to nurture a relationship with God and glorify Him.
1. Man is commanded to love and serve their fellow humans regardless of if they are friend or foe.

Point #2 is especially important as we design our social contract with each other. Understanding people will fail and designing paths for recovery from failures will be important.

Point #4 should guides us in all we do for this endeavor, bringing God Glory.

Point #5 should guide us to have plans built in to help people outside the community when we can.
