# Goals

## Project Design Goals

Keeping in mind both the defined terms and what dangers we may encounter, the goals guiding the development of this book is:

1. Design a social contract for the intentional community that builds onto the foundation provided by the host nation while striving to handle as much as possible “in house”, providing it’s members a way to manage the day to day administration of the community and resolve internal and external conflict as peacefully as possible.

1. Design technology that will allow the intentional community to be self-sufficient, providing it’s members with the basic needs of life as well as materials, tools, and support to pursue both personal and corporate projects.

1. To design everything with contingencies - so it is robust against disasters, conflict, and other sources of problems- and flexibility - so things have multiple uses and can bend to meet unusual demands.

1. To design in a way that balances individual freedom with corporate well-being.

1. To support the creation of multiple communities that can work cooperatively with each other, but still remain independent. 

1. To not abandon technology just because one is going off-grid, but redesign it to support a the different paradigm that is self-sufficiency.

1. To balance separation and integration with those outside the community.

## Community Goals

1. Promoting the values set forth in the Bible.
1. Promoting individual freedom and privacy within those values.
1. Promoting corporate well-being within those freedoms.
