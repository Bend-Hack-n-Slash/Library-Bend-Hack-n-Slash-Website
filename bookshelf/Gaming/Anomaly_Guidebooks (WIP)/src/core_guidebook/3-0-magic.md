# Magic Systems

Anomaly tries to fit any setting one might want to use and as such has built a framework for a number of types of magic systems that fit into anomaly while also aligning with the magic described in various settings: **Alchemy**, **Arcane**, **Elementalism**, **Oath**, **Psionics**, **Pact**. 

This chapter of the Core Guidebook goes over each of these in detail. For now here is a quick summery of each.

* **Alchemy** is the process of destroying ingredients to barrow their traits and add them to something else.

* **Arcane** is the construction of supernatural constructs that produce an effect on the world when powered with the user's energy.

* **Elementalism** **TODO**

* **Oath** is the use of oaths to limit your actions but gain power to effect the world.

* **Psionics** is the limiting of your body (pools) to gain mental powers that can effect the world.

* **Pact** is the binding of yourself to another to gain a portion of their power so you can effect the world.


## Underlying Source for Magic

The underlying source of all magic is a Void in the 4th spacial dimension separate from physical reality. When sentient creatures interact with the Void in various ways via their Soul they can gain power to effect reality. Interactions with the Void still function under rules, but fall under supernatural physics which often bends real physics allowing for the fantastical effects.


## Spell Effect Slots

Every magic system is based around the idea of Spell Effect Slots. How they implement it is different for each system, but each spell effect slot can hold a single spell effect from the spell list. A spell effect is composed of a **Shape** and an **Function**. So a Fireball is a ball shape with a fire function. A Fire Cone is then changing the shape from a ball shape to a cone shape.
