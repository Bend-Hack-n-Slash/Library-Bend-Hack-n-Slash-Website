# Character Creation

This chapter is an abbreviated guide dedicated to creating a new character. For more information on what each part of a character does, see the chapter on (Characters)[2-1-0-character-creation.md]

## Creating an Idea

Your character is you interaction point with the world. Their stats dictate how well they can do any particular action. So creating a character is one of the first things you do in a game. Generally you will want to flesh out the idea for the character then back it with the right stats to match the story idea with mechanics.

## Selecting a Race

Once you have the idea, one of the first things you should do is pick a race. Races are setting specific but each race has a **size modifier** which you are allowed to freely shift up or down by one degree by just saying you are more or less massive then the average for your race.

You should then note down your **Racial Perks** and **Racial Traits** on your character sheet then also note the bonuses in their relevant areas. For example the Smart racial perk adds a bonus rank to instinct and intellect, so you would note that in the attribute table's race bonus for later use.

## Levels and Experience

Each level up past level 1 awards an additional:
* 2 Attribute Points (Or 1 Paired Attribute Point)
* 1 Skill Point
* 1 Knowledge Point
* 1 Attribute Feat
* 1 Skill Feat
* 1 Knowledge Feat

So if you are creating a character that is a higher level then level 1, add the appropriate amount based on how many levels you have to the level 1 values discussed in each of the following sections.

## Points and Ranks

You get a certain number of points for each of your Attributes, Skills, and Knowledges to distribute as you see fit. How many will be detailed in their sections below. 

While assigning points, keep in mind the below table to know how many points are needed to attain each rank. You decide how many points you want to add to any character stat then note down what rank that gets you.

| Rank | Points Invested | 
| ---- | --------------- |
| 1    | 1     |
| 2    | 2-3   |
| 3    | 4-6   |
| 4    | 7-10  |
| 5    | 11-15 |


## Selecting Attributes

A Level 1 character gets 24 attribute points to distribute among 8 attributes, or 12 points if you only want to keep track of attribute pairs. The table below lists the attributes and attribute pairs:


| Merged Attribute | Defensive    | Offensive |
| --------------- :|: ---------- :|: ------- :|
| Body             | Constitution | Strength  |
| Dexterity        | Quickness    | Finesse   |
| Social           | Willpower    | Charisma  |
| Intelligence     | Instinct     | Intellect |



## Pools

After assigning your attributes you should calculate your basic pool maximums. The points, NOT rank, you put into the defensive attributes combine to create your pools. 

### Vitals
Blood is Will points + Constitution points.
Endurance is Will points + Quickness points.
Nerve is Will points + Instinct points.

### Resources
Stamina is Constitution points + Quick points.
Swiftness is Quickness points + Instinct points.
Work is Constitution points + Instinct points.
