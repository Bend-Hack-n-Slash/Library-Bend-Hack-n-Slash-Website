## Equipment Types (Very WIP)

All equipment in Anomoly is based around the concept of Quality. 


All complicated tools, from swords to rifles, are composed of three parts. Each of those three parts have their own quality score. A quality 2 sword will therefore have six qualities, each part being at least 2 quality. Usually some of them will be increased damage, it might be improved parrying, it might even be bonus damage on power attacks.



## Weapons

### Guns

The 3 part a gun has are: the manual interface, the action, and the frame. 

* The **manual interface** includes the parts that you put your hands on in order to operate the weapon so the grip, the trigger, the buttstock, the magazine eject button, etc. If you put your hands on it, it's part of the manual interface. Qualities usually focus on reducing jamming or increasing the speed at which magazines can be swapped out.

* The **action** includes the part that sends the projectiles out. Qualities allow different modes of fire, higher power, resistance to environmental clogging, and the ability to handle smart rounds. 

* The **frame** is everything from the barrel to the action housing. Higher quality allows for modifications to the rifling, hardpoints along the barrel so you can add new accessories, better durability so that you can use your weapon with less risk of breaking it in a melee situation, or magnetic enchanted chip systems that let you use your gun as a arcane blaster should you run out of ammo.




## Armor

There are several considerations to keep in mind when picking armor.

* Weight. The heavier the armor you wear, the less mobile it is. For example if your character's race is capable of flying, the odds of their wings being strong enough to fly while wearing heavy armor is low. But armor depending on how it's designed could provide assistance to mobility either via magic or technology. For example, it could have enchantments to let the character burn mana to reduce gravity's effect on their armor, or could have built in thrusters to assist in flying.


### Power Armor

Power armor is essentially a large frame with a hatch in the back that peels open and lets you slide into it. The back seals up, and the control surfaces, pads attached to rods, push down on your limbs. When you move a limb, it puts pressure on those control surfaces, and that tells the servos where to move the limb. Due to this, power armor is basically a tight fitting vehicle allowing you to also wear normal armor while inside since the control surfaces are easily adjustable.

Power armor uses a purely fictional type of recharging battery based on nuclear fusion. Expended energy will restore over a period of time. 






on that note, the type of power armor that you pilot instead of wear is also known as super heavy duty 
that would reduce it sufficiently that you would be able to use your wings to fly even with the power armor on

### Sheild Generators

how about it's shield generator?
it's totally possible that it doesn't have one. many of them do though, if only because the energy Shields can help reduce impact from EMP and the like
shield generators can do a wide variety of things. the appropriate term in this case is an energy projector. they can project holograms, extend their coverage to include allies, weaponize hard light energy to burn or bleed someone, etc
different types of energy projectors can accomplish different kinds of things. soft field energy projectors can be used for camouflage purposes, but hard light energy projectors can take more damage.
the three parts of the power frame are the power source, the frame, and the servos.
energy projectors have three main parts. the lens, the emitter, and the power source. your power frame already has a power source. this means you can spend a third fewer of the credits, or 12 credits for quality 3. 
the lens establishes the range at which and the shape which the energy can take. for example, you might have a quality that allows you to admit a wall of energy in front of an ally three spaces away to keep them covered while they are moving under fire
the projector establishes the efficiency of the drain, as well as the maximum potency. shield can be turned up or down depending on what you expect to be dealing with. it also determines the type of energy that is being emitted. if you want to be able to make a hologram, it is a quality you have to get within a soft field emitter.
hard light can make tough barriers, burning weapons, stable platforms that can be traversed,
the so-called lens it only called the lens because it is the medium through which the energy is projected.
it doesn't actually look like a fisheye or anything. it's a series of wires that go through the individuals clothing or armor.
the more energy you burn in a round, the more times your shield will be able to activate. energy Shields are relatively easy to overwhelm with any significant repeated firearms or focused fire.
the key word there is significant. if the incoming damage is not capable of damaging the energy shield, it does not count as an instance of activation.
getting an enchantment placed on the armor for the sake of gravity nullification would cost six credits for a quality 3.
having an arcane amplifier built into the frame would also allow a +3 bonus and would cost six more credits 
that plus three bonus sitting on top of your two charisma rank allows for total gravity negation
if you build in an arcane focus, it would allow you to Target other people with your gravity negation.
your size alteration ability extends to your armor and weapons. this is because it targets the space in which you and your possessions inhabit



power source qualities usually only include more power capacity, but accelerated recharging is also a desirable property. 

frame qualities are usually additional mass that can be carried, but hardpoints such as to allow for the wing protrusions are another popular one. 

servos usually opt for power, speed, or efficiency. power benefits your strength, speed benefits your quickness, and efficiency makes it so that using either of the former uses less total energy.
that is far from a comprehensive list, but it should give you an example of what a quality 3 power frame should look like

the power frame by itself, which includes the nuclear battery, costs 18 credits
armor has three parts. fittings, protectives, and attachments. 

fittings are not just about making it fit you, but also making it easy to take the armor off and on, and to fit additional armor layers on later. for a basic flack system, this would include the sappy plate pouch as well as the velcro straps that fasten it to your body. 

protectives are the particular types of protective materials you are using. Kevlar and sappy plates are protectives. this is where the bulk of your damage resistance come from. having a modular plate system allows you to change out what type of damage you are going to be more resistant to. having a layered armor system allows you to have much more armor on, as long as you can move it.

attachments is anywhere you can add accessories. simply increasing the number here is helpful, but don't misunderstand it as a one-to-one ratio. one attachment point is one point you can attach an entire belt of ammunition to for example. not just a bullet. one attachment point lets you attach an entire utility belt. you can have a lot of things in that utility belt. an attachment point can also do things like allowing you to rapidly install radios or other electronics into your helmet so that you can operate it without your hands. a very popular attachment for a helmet is for a gas mask.
the armor that you put on the power frame is its own cost.
quality one costs three credits. quality two costs nine credits. quality 3 costs 18 credits. 
if you're buying single parts, like plates, quality one costs one credit, quality two costs three credits, and quality three costs six credits


## Social Items

Grooming kits, the mechanical effect is that when you use them, you can specify a target audience type with whom you will have a bonus on social checks for a particular specialization. People who buy the high quality kits get higher quality effects.

However, if you do **not** groom for about a week, you have a bonus when dealing with other lower class or rough occupation citizens.
